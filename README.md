# Infectrate-Simulation

**Infectrate-Simulation** is an algorithm designed to predict the rate of spread of bacteria. The project simulates bacterial infection dynamics and provides a visual and analytical representation of how infection propagates over time.

## Features

- **Algorithmic simulation** of bacterial spread
- **Visualization** of infection rates and patterns
- **Customizable parameters** for simulation
- **User-friendly interface** built with JavaScript and HTML

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (86.3%)
- **HTML** (13.7%)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ea-manuel/Infectrate-Simulation.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Infectrate-Simulation
   ```

### Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Configure simulation parameters as needed.
3. Start the simulation to view the bacterial spread.

## How It Works

- The simulation calculates the rate at which bacteria spread based on configurable parameters (e.g., initial population, infection rate, grid size).
- Results are displayed visually to help users understand the infection dynamics.
